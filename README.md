Project Title: ConcealSafe

ConcealSafe is a web application designed to ensure secure and covert communication by integrating cryptography and steganography. Its goal is to enable users to not only encrypt their messages but also hide them within media files (such as images, audio, or video), making it difficult for unauthorized parties to detect the communication. This  approach ensures the protection of sensitive information against any privacy breaches.

In our project, we will develop a web application using Python and Flask. The main features include AES and RSA encryption to secure messages and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method to hide data within media files. We will integrate APIs for encryption, steganography, multi-factor authentication (MFA), public key management (PKI). This will ensure secure message sharing, as well as the ability to download hidden messages, making the platform both safe and user-friendly.


We are going to launch our project using Visual Studio, Python, and Flask by following these simple steps: First, we ensure that both Python and Flask are installed on our machine. Then, we open Visual Studio and create a new Python project. Inside the project directory, we set up and activate a virtual environment. We install Flask using the command pip install Flask. After that, we write our Flask app (e.g., app.py) with the required routes. Once the code is complete, we open the terminal in Visual Studio, navigate to our project folder, and run the app using flask run. This will start the server, and we can view the app by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in our browser.
