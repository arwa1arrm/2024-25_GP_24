Project Title: ConcealSafe

ConcealSafe is a web application designed to ensure secure and covert communication by integrating cryptography and steganography. Its goal is to enable users to not only encrypt their messages but also hide them within media files (such as images, audio, or video), making it difficult for unauthorized parties to detect the communication. This  approach ensures the protection of sensitive information against any privacy breaches.

In our project, we will develop a web application using Python and Flask. The main features include AES and RSA encryption to secure messages and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method to hide data within media files. We will integrate APIs for encryption, steganography, multi-factor authentication (MFA), public key management (PKI). This will ensure secure message sharing, as well as the ability to download hidden messages, making the platform both safe and user-friendly.
